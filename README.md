## Bundles Overview

This plugin extends Craft Commerce to support the ability to offer "product bundle" discounts. The plugin allows bundles to be defined by the user. The plugin will then match the products in the cart against the configured bundles and apply the appropriate discount based on the rules.

Functionality is also available to determine the bundles a user is currently working towards, therefore allowing in-projectt UX to guide them to the best offers.
